Write a rudimentary checkbook balancing program. It will use getline to read a line, 
which will contain either the word "check" or "deposit". The next line will contain 
the amount of the check or deposit. After reading each pair of lines, the program should 
compute and print the new balance. You can declare the variable to hold the running balance 
to be type float, and you can use the function atof (also in the standard library) to convert 
an amount string read by getline into a floating-point number. When the program reaches 
end-of-file while reading "check" or "deposit", it should exit. (In outline, the program 
will be somewhat similar to the average-finding program.) 

For example, given the input
	deposit
	100
	check
	12.34
	check
	49.00
	deposit
	7.01
the program should print something like
	balance: 100.00
	balance: 87.66
	balance: 38.66
	balance: 45.67


Extra credit: Think about how you might have the program take the word "check" or "deposit", 
and the amount, from a single line (separated by whitespace).
